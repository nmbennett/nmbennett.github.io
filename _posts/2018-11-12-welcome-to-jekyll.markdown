Despite the extensive prior work on unemployment insurance (UI), the question of how UI generosity affects the likelihood individuals migrate remains predominantly unanswered. Using data from the Survey on Income and Program Participation (SIPP) and a state-biannual panel of UI policies, I analyze the effects of UI generosity on the likelihood that an individual moves. Results from a linear probability model show that the relationship is positive for individuals that are eligible for UI, but the estimates are imprecisely measured. I then test for heterogeneous effects among groups with a higher propensity to migrate. The results suggest that people with no children and who are younger are more likely to migrate in response to greater UI generosity. My results indicate that higher levels of UI generosity induce eligible people to move, but these effects are modest.
