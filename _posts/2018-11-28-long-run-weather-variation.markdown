Global climate change is altering the landscape for farmers in developed and developing countries, causing them to adapt to new weather conditions. Using migration data from the Mexican Migration Project and a drought index from climate variables, I look at the relationship between short and medium-run changes in climate conditions on household migration decisions to the US from municipalities across Mexico. I find no relationship between short-term variation in the drought index and migration decisions. However, variation over three year averages in my climate variable will increase the probability that an individual will migrate to the United States. Using measures of destination-specific networks, I can also test whether the mechanism behind responses to long-run changes in climatic variables are linked to the progressive building of networks or if they are independent of these.
