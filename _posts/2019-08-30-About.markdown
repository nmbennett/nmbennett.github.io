I am an Economist with the U.S. Census Bureau, Labor Force Statistics Branch within the Social, Economic, and Housing Statistics Division. My research is focused on migration decisions and immigration policy. I have researched how migration from Mexico to the United States can be explained by weather shocks, and how a migration decision in the US might be determined by social insurance programs. My [most recent paper]({{ site.url }}/assets/JMPDraft.pdf) explores the relationship between local immigration policies, local law enforcement, and establishment raids conducted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. I hold a PhD in Economics from the University of California, Irvine. You can find my CV [here]({{ site.url }}/assets/NMB_resume.pdf). If you have any questions, you can contact me at neil{dot}bennett{at}census{dot}gov.
