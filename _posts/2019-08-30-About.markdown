I'm a PhD candidate in the economics department at University of California, Irvine. My research is focused on household and individual migration decisions. In my dissertation, I have researched how migration from Mexico to the United States can be explained by weather shocks, and how a migration decision in the US might be determined by social insurance programs. My job market paper explores the relationship between local immigration policies, local law enforcement, and establishment raids conducted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. You can find my CV [here]({{ site.url }}/assets/NMB_resume.pdf). If you have any questions, you can contact me at nmbennet{at}uci{dot}edu. Note that there is only one t in the email but two t's in my last name.
