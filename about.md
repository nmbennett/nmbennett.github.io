I'm a PhD candidate in the economics department at University of California, Irvine. My research is focused on applied microeconomics, public economics, and labor economics. If you have any questions, you can contact me at nmbennet{at}uci{dot}edu. Note that there is only one t in the email but two t's in my last name.
