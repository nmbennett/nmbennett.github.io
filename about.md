Wow, you must be really curious about me if you are still poking around on my website. Frankly, I'm flattered. Ok well, I'm a PhD candidate in the economics department at University of California, Irvine. My research is focused on public, labor, environmental, migration, and applied microeconomics. If you have any questions, you can contact me at nmbennet{at}uci{dot}edu. Note that there is only one t in the email but two t's in my name.
