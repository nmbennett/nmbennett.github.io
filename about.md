I'm a PhD candidate in the economics department at University of California, Irvine. My research is focused on migration decisions and immigration policy. In my dissertation, I have researched how migration from Mexico to the United States can be explained by weather shocks, and how a migration decision in the US might be determined by social insurance programs. My job market paper explores the relationship between local immigration policies, local law enforcement, and establishment raids conducted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. My work was recently featured in an article with the UCI School of Social Sciences [here](https://www.socsci.uci.edu/newsevents/news/2019/2019-07-10-bennett.php). You can find my CV [here]({{ site.url }}/assets/NMB_resume.pdf). If you have any questions, you can contact me at nmbennet{at}uci{dot}edu. Note that there is only one t in the email but two t's in my last name.
