### Understanding Establishment-Level ICE Audits

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has two primary methods by which to locate and deport undocumented individuals living within the United States: establishment audits and jail audits. Information on ICE's establishment-level audits have, until now, been only available sporadically and in aggregate form. This makes it difficult to assess what instigates them and their importance in ICE's overall domestic operations as well as what impact they may have on significant economic outcomes. I use new data on ICE's establishment audits to evaluate the causes and consequences of these audits. I find that Secure Community roll-out, which facilitates jail audits, reduces the number of establishment ICE audits in a given county by seven percent, indicating that ICE is allocating more of its time and resources on jail audits as opposed to establishment audits. Secure Community roll-out also reduces the number of undocumented individuals ICE finds in establishment audits by 11 percent, indicating that jail audits reduce the efficiency of establishment-level audits. When considering the consequences of establishment audits, I find that these audits reduce employment for individuals that are Hispanic and Asian. Yet, this relationship is imprecise. I also find that establishment audits lead to a small increase in reported crimes.

### Pulling Up Stakes During Employment Aches: Unemployment Insurance and Migration

Despite the extensive prior work on unemployment insurance (UI), the question of how UI generosity affects the likelihood individuals migrate remains predominantly unanswered. Using data from the Survey on Income and Program Participation (SIPP) and a state-biannual panel of UI policies, I analyze the effects of UI generosity on the likelihood that an individual moves. Results from a linear probability model show that the relationship is positive for individuals that are eligible for UI, but the estimates are imprecisely measured. I then test for heterogeneous effects among groups with a higher propensity to migrate. The results suggest that people with no children and who are younger are more likely to migrate in response to greater UI generosity. My results indicate that higher levels of UI generosity induce eligible people to move, but these effects are modest.

### Migration in Response to Long-Run Weather Variation

Global climate change is altering the landscape for farmers in developed and developing countries, causing them to adapt to new weather conditions. Using migration data from the Mexican Migration Project and a drought index from climate variables, I look at the relationship between short and medium-run changes in climate conditions on household migration decisions to the US from municipalities across Mexico. I find no relationship between short-term variation in the drought index and migration decisions. However, variation over three year averages in my climate variable will increase the probability that an individual will migrate to the United States. Using measures of destination-specific networks, I can also test whether the mechanism behind responses to long-run changes in climatic variables are linked to the progressive building of networks or if they are independent of these.
